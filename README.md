# Comp-Sci-Final-Project



# To run our website you will need to do the following :



1. Install Node.js and npm on your computer. Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript on your computer, and npm is the package manager for Node.js that allows you to install third-party packages and libraries. You can download and install Node.js and npm from the official website: https://nodejs.org/

2. Once you have Node.js and npm installed, you can use the npm command to install the React library. Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command: npm install react

3. After installing the React library, you can create a new React project by running the following command: npx create-react-app <project-name>, where <project-name> is the name of your project. This will create a new directory with the given name and generate the necessary files and folders for a React project inside it.

4. To run your React code, navigate to the project directory and run the following command: npm start. This will start a development server that will automatically recompile your code whenever you make changes and refresh the page in your browser to reflect those changes.

5. To install files and branches from GitHub that will be used, you will need to follow these additional steps:

6. Navigate the repository on GitHub that contains the files and branches you will need to install.

7.If you want to install a specific branch, go to the "Branch" dropdown menu and select the branch you want to install.  Which will be the " everything documented " branch.

8.Click on the "Clone or download" button and copy the URL for the repository.

9.In your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project directory where you want to install the files and run the following command: git clone <repository-url>, where <repository-url> is the URL you copied in the previous step. This will download the files from the repository and create a new local Git repository in your project directory.

10. After installing the files, you may need to run npm install to install any dependencies listed in the project's package.json file.

11. once done you should be able to run the code and acces the website.
